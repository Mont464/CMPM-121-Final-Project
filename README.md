## Introducing the team
-Tools Lead - Guy
-Engine Lead - Riley, Alejandro
-Design Lead - Niko, Brian

## Tools and materials
1. We chose to use baseline web as our engine starting out. We chose this since it's the engine that we collectively have the most experience in, and have been using the whole quarter. 
2. Typescript and JSONs will likely be our only languages in this project, unless one of the curveball requirements forces us to switch. Again, it's the languages we all have the most experience in.
3. VSCode, Github, Deno, and photoshop if we end up making our own assets. Keeping our toolset limited to things we've used this quarter means we save time teaching teammates about a certain program.
4. Phaser will be our alternate platform, since we all have experience using it in CMPM 120.

## Outlook
We think the hardest part of making our game is going to be making it look interesting and fun while in the limitations of baseline HTML and typescript. We will likely be looking to how games like Universal Paperclips utilize HTML elements to diversify different sections of its UI.
We hope to learn how to be better at HTML/CSS via this limitation, so that we can all build better skillsets when it comes to straight web development. 
In terms of what we want to accomplish that other teams may not attempt, we doubt many groups will be taking this route of trying to make a baseline web game look good. If we can accomplish a smooth UX with these limitations, our game would stick out from other baseline projects.
